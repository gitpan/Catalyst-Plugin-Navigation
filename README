NAME
	Catalyst::Plugin::Navigation - A navigation plugin for Catalyst

DESCRIPTION

	The Catalyst::Plugin::Navigation plugin provides a way to define the
	navigation elements and hierarchy within the Catalyst controllers. By
	defining the menu structure from the controller attributes a controller can
	then ask for any level of menu and be presented with the current chain to
	the active page as well as all other visable menus from the hirearchy.
	Instead of having to define the menu structure and navigation elements and
	links in an external source this can be done from the infomation available
	from the controllers themselves.
